; This file enables you to specify a default application root used during development.
; The application root is used to locate the database file. The sub-directory "db" is always appended
; to obtain: <applicationRoot>\db<DatabaseFileName>
;
; During normal application execution, the directory from which the app is running is used
; as the application root.This setting is only used when the path to the executable includes:
;
;   "bin\debug", "bin\release"
;   "bin\x86\debug", "bin\x86\release"
;   "bin\x64\debug", "bin\x64\release"
;
; This check occurs in the constructor of the ApplicationInfo class,
; which looks at the executing assembly location and sets its RootFolder property.
